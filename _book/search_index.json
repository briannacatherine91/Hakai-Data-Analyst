My hope is this guide will teach you a prescribed methodology that results in; high analytical quality, reproducible research methods, understanding the benefits of open science practices, and opens the world of collaboration for anlaysts to contribute to each others projects. The beginning of this guide may seem difficult, but in making this guide I’ve kept long-term goals in mind and in a sense I have front-loaded the R learning experience with important concepts that will serve you in the near future and in the long-run. 1.1 Acknowledgements Much of this document simply refers you to material that others have worked very hard to make simple. I simply point to these resources in an order that makes sense to me and forms a systematic approach. Many thanks to the following people for making this possible: * Dr. Jenny Bryan, UBC Professor in the Masters of Data Science Program. Twitter, GitHUB. * Dr. Roger Peng, Professor of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Website, GitHUB. * Dr. Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientists at R-Studio. Website, Twitter, GitHUB. "]
